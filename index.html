              <p>
                A replacement for "culture fit" is "culture add". The idea is, "will this person
                <span class="fst-italic">add</span> to the culture that we want to build?" instead of focusing on "do
                they look and sound and act like us?" That's one of the benefits of having a well-defined culture that
                you strive for; now you can assess where your group is deficient and specifically hire people who fill
                those gaps.

              <h5>Metaphor for bureaucracy as a load balancer</h5>
              <p>
                I think of bureaucracy as a load balancer on a web server. You could go faster if you bypassed the load
                balancer and went straight to the web server: it's one less network hop, it's a little less processing
                time, maybe you shave a few milliseconds off of every request. But, you can serve a lot more requests
                concurrently if you're willing to take that little overhead and have a load balancer in your web
                service. I think of well-designed bureaucracy as that. Well-designed bureaucracy facilitates large-scale
                collaboration and large-scale progress even though it reduces the optimization of individual resources
                or people getting things done.

              <p>
                Give the project a name. For whatever reason, when projects or ideas have names, they get purchase in
                people's minds more permanently. Instead of "that long thing that takes three paragraphs to describe
                that people can't remember the details of", if you give it a name, like "The Jabberwocky Project", it
                will stick in people's minds.

              <h5>Adopting multiple technologies increases ramp-up time for learning their gotchas.</h5>
              <p>
                It is actually hard to be productive and effective in different technologies (e.g. web frameworks)
                because each has their own razorblades hiding around corners that you can walk into and get cut and not
                realize it. Part of the skill of using a particular technology is building a mental checklist of all the
                things you can do wrong in that technology. So if you use two technologies, that could result in more
                quality problems in your product because the developers are making mistakes that don't need to be made
                because they haven't learned it yet. So you have a doubling of ramp-up time for when your developers can
                be productive.

              <p>
                Effective documentation culture comes from writing *first*, not last. It's not build a bunch of stuff
                and <span class="fst-italic">then</span> go back and do the drudge work of writing down what you built.
                It's writing down what you plan to build, using that as a tool for reviewing with others whether you're
                on the right track, and then build it, and then (and this doesn't even happen at good documentation
                culture places), go back and update your documentation to match what you built.

              <h5>1:1s are sometimes very helpful and otherwise not harmful.</h5>
              <p>
                In my mind, having a regular one-on-one scheduled with your manager is there because
                <span class="fst-italic">sometimes</span> it will be very helpful, and the rest of the time it won't be
                harmful. Sometimes you'll have really important stuff to talk about, or you'll share important
                information or context that will change things. And the rest of the time you're just getting to know
                that person. You have to have that cadence and habit of talking for when there is something really
                important to talk about.
